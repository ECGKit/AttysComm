Python API for the Attys (www.attys.tech).

Attys is a lightweight bluetooth DAQ box which can measure
anything from temperature to ECG.




QUICK START GUIDE

```
  # load the module
  import pyattyscomm

  # Gets the AttysScan class which scans for Attys via bluetooth
  s = pyattyscomm.AttysScan()

  # Scan for Attys
  s.scan()

  # get the 1st Attys
  c = s.getAttysComm(0)

  # if an attys has been found c points to it. Otherwise it's None.

  # Start data acquisition in the background
  c.start()

  # Now we just read data at our convenience in a loop or timer or thread
  # if data is available you can read it from the ringBuffer

  while (not c.hasSampleAvilabale()):
    # do something else or nothing

  # getting a sample (array of all Attys channels)
  sample = c.getSampleFromBuffer()

  # do something with the sample
  print(sample)

  # rinse and repeat!

API DOCUMENTATION

```
  import pyattyscomm
  help(pyattyscomm.AttysScan)
  help(pyattyscomm.AttysComm)
```

The python API is identical to the C++ one:

The header files AttysComm.h and AttysScan.h provide more
detailed info.







DEMOS

On github you find two python demos: one which prints the
ADC data to the screen and one which plots it with matplotlib.
